# Privacy Policy for ClipLinks Browser Extension

**Last Updated:** [2024-04-03]

This Privacy Policy describes how the ClipLinks browser extension ("ClipLinks", "the Extension", "we", "us") handles information when you use it.

**Information Handled**

ClipLinks is designed with your privacy as a priority. The **only** information the Extension handles is the data you explicitly provide:

*   The URLs (web addresses) you enter into the Extension's settings.
*   The display names or usernames you associate with those URLs.
*   Your icon preference (platform icon or custom emoji) for each link.

**Data Storage**

All the information listed above (URLs, names, icon preferences) is stored **exclusively** within your web browser's local storage (`chrome.storage.local`).

**Data Transmission and Sharing**

ClipLinks **does not** transmit, collect, or share any of your stored information or any other personal data with any external servers, databases, or third parties. All your configured link data remains entirely on your own computer within your browser's storage, managed solely by the Extension for its core functionality.

**Permissions**

ClipLinks requires the following browser permission:

*   `storage`: This permission is necessary solely to save and retrieve your configured links locally within your browser, allowing the Extension to function correctly between sessions.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the Extension's repository or listing. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
