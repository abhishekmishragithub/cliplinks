## Features

*   **One-Click Copy:** Click any configured profile in the popup to instantly copy the full URL to your clipboard.
*   **Clean Popup UI:** Displays your links clearly with platform icons and your chosen display text/username.
*   **Easy Configuration:** Add, edit, and delete profiles via a straightforward Settings page.
*   **Lightweight & Fast:** Designed to be minimal and responsive.

## Installation

Since this extension isn't on the official browser web stores (yet!), you need to load it manually as an "unpacked extension":

1.  **Download:**
    *   Go to the [**Releases** page](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ClipLinks/releases) (Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username) and download the latest `.zip` file (e.g., `cliplinks-v1.0.0.zip`).
    *   **OR**, if you prefer, [clone or download](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ClipLinks/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) this repository's `main` branch.
2.  **Unzip:** Extract the downloaded `.zip` file into a dedicated folder on your computer. You should have a folder containing `manifest.json`, `popup.html`, `icons/`, etc.
3.  **Open Browser Extensions:**
    *   **Chrome/Brave:** Type `chrome://extensions` in your address bar and press Enter.
    *   **Edge:** Type `edge://extensions` in your address bar and press Enter.
4.  **Enable Developer Mode:** Find the "Developer mode" toggle (usually in the top-right corner) and switch it **ON**.
5.  **Load Unpacked:**
    *   Click the "Load unpacked" button that appears.
    *   Navigate to and select the **folder** where you extracted the extension files (the folder that directly contains the `manifest.json` file).
6.  **Done!** The ClipLinks icon should now appear in your browser's toolbar. You might need to click the puzzle piece icon (üß©) to pin it.
